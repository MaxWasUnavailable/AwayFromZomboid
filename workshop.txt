title=AwayFromZomboid - AFK detection & management!
description=Away From Zomboid adds a highly configurable AFK system to your Project Zomboid server!
description=
description=
description=The system detects player activity when they use any controls, or click their mouse. This should have a minimal impact on performance, and still be close to perfect as far as detection goes. The timer is checked every in game minute, and hence might be off from configured values by a couple of seconds - this should not be noticeable unless you have extremely low timeout values. The mod also runs completely clientside.
